# CustomersAPI

creating the prototype with the first httpGet was 1 hour aprox and updating it to use a a httpget for ID, httpget for Name and httpPut for create that works was aprox another hour. I decided to keep the files in the same project to save time but i respected the structure and dependencies that they could have in the future if we refactor the project with clean architecture making an easier transition.

The DB is a class that keeps some autogenerated records in memory.
